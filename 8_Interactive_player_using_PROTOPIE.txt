CREATE AN INTERACTIVE PLAYER PROTOTYPE USING PROTOPIE 

AIM: To create an interactive player prototype using protopie.

PROCEDURE:

Step 1: Setting up the Project
    1. Download and install ProtoPie (if you haven't already).
    2. Launch ProtoPie and create a new project.
    3. Set the canvas size to a mobile device resolution (e.g., 375x667 for iPhone 8).

Step 2: Designing the Player UI
    1. Create a circle for the play/pause button.
    2. Create another circle for the skip button.
    3. Design a rectangle for the progress bar.

Step 3: Adding Interactions
    1. Select the play/pause button and open the "Interaction" panel.
    2. Click on "Add Interaction" and select "On Tap."
    3. Choose "Toggle" as the interaction type.
    4. Select the play/pause button again, and in the "Layers" panel, create two states: "Play"
    and "Pause." Design each state accordingly (e.g., play icon in the "Play" state and
    pause icon in the "Pause" state).

Step 4: Adding Progress Animation
    1. Select the progress bar and open the "Interaction" panel.
    2. Click on "Add Interaction" and select "On Tap."
    3. Choose "Change Property" as the interaction type.
    4. Select the progress bar, choose the "Transform" property, and set the "Scale" property
    to increase the width of the progress bar to simulate progress.

Step 5: Adding Skip Interaction
    1. Select the skip button and open the "Interaction" panel.
    2. Click on "Add Interaction" and select "On Tap."
    3. Choose "Change Screen" as the interaction type.
    4. Create a new screen that represents the next song or a skip action.

Step 6: Testing the Prototype
    1. Connect a mobile device to the ProtoPie Player app.
    2. Click the "Play" button to simulate the play/pause action.
    3. Tap the progress bar to simulate song progress.
    4. Tap the skip button to navigate to the next song screen.

Step 7: Refining the Prototype
    1. Adjust animations, transitions, and timings to make the interactions feel natural.
    2. Test the prototype with potential users and gather feedback for improvements.

RESULT: Thus interactive player prototype using protopie has been created.
