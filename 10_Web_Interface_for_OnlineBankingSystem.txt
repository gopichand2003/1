DESIGN A WEB INTERFACE FOR ONLINE BANKING SYSTEM

AIM: To design a web interface for online banking systems using balsamiq design software

PROCEDURE:
Step 1: Understand the Requirements
Before you start designing, make sure you have a clear understanding of the features and
functionalities required for the online banking system. This may include user authentication,
account overview, fund transfers, transaction history, bill payments, and more.

Step 2: Start a New Project
    1. Launch Balsamiq.
    2. Create a new project with a suitable canvas size (e.g., desktop or mobile resolution).

Step 3: Design the Main Layout
    1. Begin with the main layout, which typically includes a header, sidebar or navigation,
    and a content area.
    2. Use simple shapes (rectangles, text boxes, buttons) to represent each of these
    elements.
    3. Arrange them in a clean and intuitive manner.

Step 4: Design Key Pages
Design the following key pages, keeping the overall user flow in mind:
    1. Login Page:
        o Include fields for username and password.
        o Add a "Login" button.
        o Consider including a "Forgot Password" link.
    2. Account Overview Page:
        o Display account balances.
        o Show recent transactions.
        o Include navigation to other sections.
    3. Transfer Funds Page:
        o Provide fields for selecting source and destination accounts.
        o Include an amount field.
        o Add a "Transfer" button.
    4. Transaction History Page:
        o Display a list of past transactions.
        o Include filters and sorting options.
    5. Bill Payments Page:
        o Allow users to select the biller.
        o Include fields for entering payment details.
        o Add a "Pay" button.

Step 5: Use Balsamiq Components
Take advantage of Balsamiq's pre-built components to create a more realistic and consistent
design. Customize the components to match the branding and overall look of an online
banking system.

Step 6: Maintain Clarity and Simplicity
    1. Use clear and concise labels.
    2. Maintain a clean and consistent visual style.
    3. Prioritize user-friendly interactions.
    4. Ensure the design is responsive if you're designing for multiple screen sizes.

Step 7: Review and Iterate
    1. Review the wireframes/mockups for usability and completeness.
    2. Gather feedback from stakeholders or potential users.
    3. Iterate on the design based on the feedback received.

RESULT: Thus a web interface for online banking systems using balsamiq design software
has been designed .
